So today I'm talking to Dr. James W. Pennebaker, he is professor of psychology at the university of Texas at Austin, and the executive director of project twenty twenty one, aimed at rethinking undergraduate education at that university. His cross disciplinary research is related to linguistics, clinical and cognitive psychology, communications, medicine and computer science. He and his students have explored natural language use,  group dynamics and personality in educational and other real world settings. He has demonstrated that physical health and work performance
can be improved by simple writing or talking exercises. Dr. Pennebaker has received numerous awards and honors has written or edited more than two hundred and fifty scientific articles as well as nine books including more recently, <i>[Expressive Writing: Words That Heal](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21448988-expressive-writing)</i> and <i>[The Secret Life of Pronouns](https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/secret-life-of-pronouns-9781608194964/#:~:text=In The Secret Life of,concept%2C and our social intelligence.)</i>. He also happens to be one of my favorite psychologists. Welcome Dr. Pennebaker, I'm very much looking forward to talking to you.



[Pennebaker]

Well, it's nice to be here, thank you.



[Peterson]

Great, so as you may know what, because I think we've talked about this a little bit before, I developed some computer, online-computerized writing programs with my colleagues. One of which we call "Future Authoring," one's "Past Authoring", one's "Present Authoring." They're a suite of writing programs, and they were heavily influenced in their design by your research.

My lab's been interested in narrative for a long time and also in clinical work, and also in the application of psychology, in the real-world setting, in the practical setting. I spent a lot of time developing tests to help employers screen for employees, and we got pretty good at that.

But while I was doing that, I was constantly bombarded with questions from managers of middle managers, usually of medium-sized in large corporations, telling me that it was all well and good if we could hire better employees, but they wanted to know what they could do with their poor-performing employees because that was a continual and intractable problem. And I thought:“Well, you don't have that much interaction with them, and it's not that easy to solve people's problems, so there's probably not a lot you could do.”But I kind of got sick of telling people that over and over, and so I scoured the literature.

It was at that point, probably about 15 years ago, 10-15 years ago, that I came across your research on expressive writing. So maybe you could start by telling us what you learned and how you went about it?

[Pennebaker]

Okay, a little bit of background, I'm a social psychologist by training, so I don't have any clinical training. Most of my career has just been stumbling upon one idea after another, as opposed to approaching anything with a clear set of where it was going. I've been looking at mind-body issues, I've always been interested in how psychological factors influence physical health and mental health, and I came across a finding years ago that just bugged me, and that was people who have had a major traumatic experience in their lives were much more likely to get sick than people who had not. Now, that was an old finding, but as I dug in more deeply, what I discovered was people who had a trauma and kept it secret were far more likely to have health problems than people who had the same trauma but who talked with others about it. And it made me wonder what if we brought people into the lab and had them actually write about some kind of trauma, ideally when they hadn't talked to other people about it. Would that influence their health? And that was really the underlying idea. So the very first study was done in 1983, and we brought in about fifty people. Some of them were asked to write about the most dramatic experience of their lives, the other half were asked to write about superficial topics. I'm simplifying the study some, and they wrote for four days, 15 minutes a day, and they also gave us permission to track their student health center records. These were college students, and this was at a private college where the student health center was right next to the dorms.

Well, what we discovered was that those people who were asked about traumatic experiences ended up going to the student health center at about half the rate as people in our controlled condition, the ones who had written about superficial topics over the next three to six months. And this was a really stunning finding. It was you know what I kind of hoped would occur, but I never... I was so thrilled that it actually worked. And then we did another study that was very similar, and here again we had half the people write about traumas, half write about superficial topics, and they wrote about trauma or superficial topics by a flip of the coin. We decided which of the two topics they'd write about, and this time we drew blood before we assigned them to condition, again after the last day of writing, and then six weeks later, and the blood was assayed by a group of people at Ohio State looking at immune function. And again, we found that writing about traumatic experiences was associated with enhanced immune function and also reductions in doctor visits.

And this now takes us to about 1988, and by then other labs started to see what we were doing, and the whole technique started to take off. And then over the years, more and more labs including my own, found generally positive effects, not always, but generally, that writing about upsetting experiences had this salutary effect that influenced both health, physical health, and markers of mental health, and then later various labs found it to be related to all sorts of things associated with increased memory, cognitive functioning, and so forth.





so if i remember correctly as well
when you were doing the earliest studies
you were also influenced by freud's idea that
of catharsis and that was the idea that
if people had a traumatic or unpleasant experience if they were
encouraged to
express the emotions that were associated with that
experience that
that would be curative
that was partly freud's hypothesis well
it was a little bit
it is important
it is absolutely consistent with with
initial idea and what was interesting is
because most people listening to this podcast
will hear catharsis
and they will think that catharsis means blowing off scene
reventing and that's not actually what freud actually meant
and it's interesting in Europe
catharsis has a completely different meaning
than it does in North America
so in North America we view it as venting
freud and Europeans do catharsis as
connecting emotions and thoughts
and that is actually what i was doing
i had assumed that freud vanting
and we had found actually that people who just blew Austin
who just expressed emotions
actually didn't show any health improvements
you need a linguistic analysis right
and that was
one of the things that was really
fascinating about the research
so maybe you could tell us a bit about that
too
well
i wasn't initially
again
i have never
had never been
interested in
in psychotherapy and here
all of a sudden i was doing
a study that was essentially glorified psychotherapy
that which got me
speaking to clinicians
and then the question was
why does writing about an upsetting experience
bring about these changes
and it's a straightforward question
but there's not a straightforward answer
in my lab and others
started looking at all sorts of possibilities
and looking at markers of
inhibition you know that people holding back
were more prone to illness
and what this did was to loosen them up
we didn't find good evidence for that other people had
other hypotheses
and at some point i started looking at what
people were actually saying
and i got groups of people
students who are in clinical psychology
to rate the essays that people wrote
on all these different dimensions and what i found was that
relying on
people to read these essays and come up with some kind of deep
understanding
or even predicting if a person would benefit or not
just didn't work
it was too hard the stories were really traumatic
and they actually depressed a lot of the people who were in our
who were reading the essay
so it occurred to me
it would make much more sense to come up with some objective
marker of reading
these essays and a computer program would be what i needed
it turns out back
then this was now the early 90s there was no such program
and fortunately
i had taken a little computer science in college
and one of my graduate students Martha
Francis had actually done some done
her undergraduate degree in computer science
and so i asked Martha to
essentially helped me
do a computer program that could go through and analyze
the language of an essay and
the idea behind it is really quite simple
you have the computer go in and look at each word
and you would compare each word in the essay
with some master list of words
so let's say
we're looking for
anger words we want the computer to count up all
the words associate with anger
so we'd have this Dictionary of anger words
and to get that dictionary we had to make that ourselves we had
to look in dictionaries the sources we had to
have students generate anger words
and then we had all these rules of
what makes for an anger word versus not
but once you have that list
you go through
and you have the computer look at each word compared
with a master list
and anytime it finds an anger word it just adds it up
and at the end
it adds up all the anger words
divides by the total number of words
and it produces the percentage of total anger words
in the essay and we did this now for
not just anger words or sad words guilt words
negative emotion words in general
but we did positive emotion words and then cognitive words
words that suggestly cause an effect like cause because
effect rationale words like that
and then as long
as we were doing it we added more and more dimensions
we had pronouns of prepositions and articles etc
we ended up with about
now if there's probably 80 different dimensions
but
when we went back and started looking at essays
we found that certain dimensions of writing
really predicted health improvements
now we found that
use of positive emotions was associated with health improvement
so if you can write an essay
about the worst thing in your life
and still use positive emotions
it's a marker that you're going to show health improvements
the effects are pretty small
negative emotion words using a moderate number of negative
emotions is weekly related to doing better as well
but what turned out to be far stronger was
use of cognitive words words like because cause effect
words like understand realize no
these are worse we now know are
markers of people working through a problem so
let me ask you a question about that
because i thought a lot about that i thought that was really
an interesting idea so
this question has to do with the function of memory
so it's pretty obvious that we don't and can't store
what's the equivalent of a videotape of the entire
domain of sensory experience
when we're interacting with people
and it is obvious as well
that that isn't how memory works and that memory is modifiable
across time and so
here's a hypothesis for you and
tell me what you think about
this
it seems to me that the the purpose of memory is so that
you can
remember the good things that happened to you in the past
and how they occurred and duplicate them in the future
and remember the bad things that happened and figure out why
and change your course of life and your pathway in the future
so that they occur less frequently and so
the cause and effect analysis would be something like
the adjustment of
a pathway map
and
it sort of reminds me of the work that was done with rat memory
because
the hippocampus seems to store something like cognant of maps
and maps almost by definition are
are are representations of ways to get from one place to another
and so you can think maybe that
you go from one place to another and you fall into a hole
and that's very traumatic and so
you remember the pathway and how you got there analyze it
and reconstruct a different
potential future causal pathway
so that you don't have to fall in the same hole twice
now i don't know what you think about that but
well i think that actually
i think that works is true both
the way you describe it
but also on a much broader metaphorical level
so for example
a person who falls into an emotional
hold that their life is going well
and then their girlfriend dumps them
and they they
go and get drunk in a bar and
wreck their car
that experience is incredibly incredibly complex and
unlike the rat
what the human mind has to figure out
what in the world went on with my girlfriend
why did she leave me
what did i do
why did i go get drunk have i been drinking too much and
to process that requires tremendous cognitive capacity
and what happens is if it's something we're humiliated about
we're really reticent to talk to other people about it
and language is a really efficient way to process complex issues
shared language you know
that's right well
so what i found in my clinical practice very frequently is that
i think with people who are traumatized
they often encounter
this is something else i wanted to ask you about
they often have an encounter with malevolence
as well as as a call as an encounter with just catastrophe
so it's not only that something bad happens to them
it's often something bad that's been
consciously directed at them by another person
and they have a really hard time mapping
that especially if there's somewhat
naive people
but then
the other people who are detrimentally affected by such things
i can't recover
are those who have no one to listen to them
because people it seems to me that most people think by talking
and unless you have someone to talk to you actually
don't get to think through it and draw the appropriate
let's call them causal
lessons so and then you also made this comment about
you know let's say
the classic example i like to use is that you know
maybe you're a premead student and you write the
the medical
the g what is it what's the one for medical entrance
the am caft yeah
yeah yeah
so you know you construe yourself as a pretty solid student
and that's a core element of your of like
it's a predicate of the multiple maps of your life that you use
and then you write the mcad and you end up with
20th percentile scores
and so then what happens is that
not only is your map of the future now rendered null and void
but so is your map of
you as a predicate for present actions and also
everything about yourself that you
thought held true in the past has to be re examined
so it's something like
the degree of trauma is proportionate to the amount of the area
that
of map that's disturbed by the
by the
by the unfortunate unexpected and sometimes malevolent event
and so then the other thing i was thinking about
with regards to this and i think this is
the more germain to the immunological element is
so it's obviously very very difficult
for the mind to compute how dangerous the environment is
because the environment in some sense is infinitely dangerous
and you never know when something
small happens to you if it's the harbinger
of something that's terrible
so because an ache in your side can be the cancer the kills you
you might ask yourself
given the complexity
of framing in an unexpected event how do you ever manage it
part of its temperamental
so if you're higher in neuroticism things hit you harder
and part of it is based on your observed confidence
but the other part i think is something like
it's something like
the brain computes
the proportion of times that you failed in the past
compared to the proport to the times that you've succeeded
and calculates like a mean danger index
and then it raises up your average cortisol levels in
correspondence to how dangerous
the general environment has been
because that puts you on alert more
and the problem with the advantage to being going alert is that
well if anything else negative happens
you're more ready
to act
but the negative consequences is that cortisol is toxic in in
reason you know in high doses across time and it also
suppresses immunological function
and it also tends to suppress prefrontal functioning as well
because pre the prefrontal cortex is more
involved in long medium to long term planning
and less in short term
like emergency preparation activity so i'd also like to know
you know does that do those ideas
bring a bell did they see
so they do that
there's an interesting
so there's another dimension that ties into this
and that is sleep
so we know the sleeps is intimately related to corresolves
related to depression
it's related to immune function
it's related to you know all of these systems are
intercorelated
and the person who is
dealing with an upheaval that they're trying to understand
but they Don't have somebody to talk to end up
not sleeping as well and part of it is
they're trying to process all this additional information
and this ties
into the idea of working memory
that they have less working memory they're not sleeping as well
court is all is higher
and they are also worse friends so that
so when you talk to them
they're distracted they're not paying attention and
so all of these things
are working together to undermine the person
now the cortisol hypothesis is a wonderful hypothesis
the killer
problem is that the studies that have been done with cortisol
and it's linked to writing and trauma
have been
you'd have to stand back and look at the
overall studies and kind of squint
and there's a weak evidence to support it
but it's it's not as clean as i wish it were
of course this has been the problem
with the writing research
but it's also the problem of all clinical research
that there is
you know once you start getting
real data
and this is not just self reports of a client saying oh
yeah
that was really great when you start to get objective hard data
everything is kind
of off the table that the effect sizes are very very modest
and by the way
that's true of medical outcomes as well for medical disease
so okay so
the downward spiral that you sort of described
there too could also account for
could also account for the negative health consequences post
trauma i mean so you can imagine exactly things that
first of all
is that the traumatized person is gonna be more reactive to
to additional trauma
but also that as they
as the effects of their failure cascades
say across their friendship
interfere with their
educational function interfere with their sleep
the quality of their life overall is going to decline
and that should also produce
multiple small stressors that are going to compromise them
including say
the decrease sleep and maybe also alterations and appetite
and those might accumulate
across time
and produce the negative health consequences as well
yes and don't forget this will smoke more drink
more take more drugs stop exercising
yes kids out there when you have a trauma
take care of yourself right
right right yes yes well
yeah well i mean the first thing i do with my clinical clients
generally speaking
is make sure that they're getting enough sleep
and to try to reregulate their sleeping
and also to make sure they eat breakfast at least
because that without those two things
it's very difficult for someone
to get themselves back on the straight and narrow
so now when we designed the self authoring program
i think i had read i think it was researched by Laura king
but i Don't remember somebody had taken your
your writing exercises and applied them to the future had
people write about the future instead of the past
and found similar effects was that Laura king
do you remember
yeah that's Laura and what was interesting was that study
you would think having people write
what she thought was she'd have
people write about the past versus
write about the future versus both
and her idea was that having them write about both
would be best cause in it way
therapy sometimes works in that way so
let's work through their
their issues and what are the implications for the future
mm hmm
she found that writing about both
actually wasn't very effective that having them write about
the future was beneficial or just the past was beneficial
and since then there's been a lot of other studies
looking at having
people write about just positive effects
and or just negative
what is generally found is that writing about positive effects
is also beneficial for health
well what
it kind of indicates is the thinking is beneficial for health
i think that's true and it's also
you know the best studies
as i stand back and look at the kind of the broad
panorama of research is
giving people instructions to write
really loosely in the sense of
here you write about
the most traumatic experience of your life but
you know a lot of people haven't had traumas
or maybe you've come to terms with traumas
but for right about those topics that are weighing upon
you the most right now
they may be positive
they may be negative
they may be most or a little bit of both and essentially
that's what i encourage people to do is to
if you're having trouble sleeping
set aside 15 minutes
and just explore your thoughts and feelings about issues
that are weighing on you maybe something that you
Don't want to talk about
or something you Don't really want to address yeah
yeah well when we set up the future
i'll i'll run you by
the latest research on the future authoring program
because you you won't know about all of it but
so basically what we've done with the future authoring program
which is the one with
which now we've administered to
thousands of university students
in different locales with very very
stable results and the results are quite remarkable i think
so the way the thing is structured is
we first get people to consider
six important dimensions of their life
so we're kind of construing the individual as something
that's distributed to cross dimensions
practical dimensions so those are
um intimate relationship friendships
family
career education
time spent outside of work
and use of drugs
and alcohol
because that's a rabbit hole people can really go down
and having
at least an idea of how you should handle
intoxicating substances is better than just going
into it blindly
so the first thing
we get people to write about and loosely following that idea
it's like a free association idea in psychoan analysis right
it's like but it also i think freeze people up to make mistakes
because they get up tight if they have to do it right
you have to say look
you don't have to do it right you can do it badly
it's better than not doing it at all
so
we have them right about
to envision what
they would like if they could have
what they wanted on each of those domains
it's like okay
it's three to five years down the road
imagine you're taking care of yourself
and as if you were someone you cared about
and that things were set up optimally for you
hypothetically what would that look like
and what i found
in my clinical practice very frequently
is that people are afraid of specifying their future
because they're afraid of hope
but also there's an avoidance element which is that
once you specify your criteria for success
you've also specified your criteria for failure
and if you keep things vague and ill defined
then you can stumble along without ever
really noticing that you're lost and it's a really bad strategy
in the medium to long term but
but i think it's it's effective as a means of
well its effective self deception in the short term
anyways they do that first
and then we get them to write for 15 minutes
no concern for spelling or grammar
which i think we took directly from your research
and just to sketch out what
life could be like three three years down the road
if they had what would be good for them
alright
and so now that that also gives them something to aim for right
and so one of one of the things that we
we've been thinking through
with regards to having something to aim for is the fact that
the systems that utilize dopamine the incentive reward systems
which which basically produce most of the positive emotion that
of the kind that people really like
only respond in relationship to a specified goal
so you feel
an incentive reward kit when you're moving towards a valued
target
so if there's no value target
there's no positive emotion in life
except in consequence of direct pleasures say
but there's no ongoing excitement or enthusiasm about
tackling hard problems for example
because there's no
evidence that those are related to a value destination
and it's the entire dopaminogic system that that that
that responds to that and that's of course
the system that cocaine in drugs like that effect
and so then we do something else
which we've introduced more recently which is we say okay now
look you specified the positive poll
and that gives you
something to run towards
now we want you to think through the ways
the faults that you have and
the resentment and anger that you hold for whatever
it is that you're angry about and resentful
about an unhappy about
and to consider your bad habits and imagine
where those could drag you
three to five years from now if you
let them take the upper hand
and so people write about that for 15 minutes
and we think well that gives them
a negative poll to run away from
like a hell to run away from and a heaven to run towards
and there's some good evidence from the animal literature that
animals that are running away
and running towards at the same time
are run faster they're more motivated
and then in the second half
they lay out a well articulated long term implementable plan
and we try to get them to deeply articulated say well you know
Drake it into eight goals
rank order the goals
if you attained goal number one why would that be good for you
why would it be good for your family
why would it be good for broader society
what would you do with obstacles
a rose okay so that's the pattern and and now
at the university of
Rotterdam at the business school there
so it's the Rotterdam school of management i've been working
with michaela shippers there and her colleagues
we've run about 7
000 people through that now
and the research indicates there's a bunch of interesting things
overall it's raised great point
average about 20 percent and drop their dropout rate about 25
percent which is absolutely phenomenal it was
far larger effects than we would have imagined
but the effects are quite interesting because you know
with most interventions
you re if there's a distribution of performance
you intervene and you raise the higher performing people
even higher
you know absent a ceiling effect right
right
but this has the opposite effect it raises the lower end up
and so
at Rotterdam the students that were most positively affected
were the ones who were performing the worst
and there we divided them up by gender
and ethnicity
so male female obviously but then we divided them into
ethnic hollanders so mostly Caucasian natives and
then non western ethnic minorities
so the males were under performing the females
and then
it was female
Dutch natives male Dutch natives
female non western ethnic minorities
male non westing ethnic minorities there was a big gap
between the Dutch females and the
non western ethnic minority men
within two years of completing the program
the non ethnic western minority men passed the Dutch women
even though very cool and also increased a little bit yeah
so and then we replicated that more recently in Canada at
a little college called Mohawk college
and we found there that
men were under performing women again
and then we divided them into how
well
they were doing in high school before they came into college
and the worst performing
males were the ones who were doing poorly
in university before they hit college
or the sorry the males who were in high school
and who had the worst grades were those
who improved most
with the use of the future authoring program and
they all they did the whole thing in an hour
badly
in one
session
that's very impressive could you send me a copy of that
i'd love to see that no problem
because that's it
because it hasn't been released but i can send you
i'll send you the rest of them but yeah
that's fabulous because
these are the issues of course i'm dealing with right now
here at the university of Texas trying to find out
you know most of the interventions that we are looking at
is essentially aiming at lower social class kids
who are coming to college for the first time who face
so many obstacles that the upper middle class students
aren't even aware exist
no well
we're trying to think through why this works you know and so
part of it is i think and i thought this through a lot
part of it is i think that
the schools before college
never require really require kids to make a decision
and they don't teach them how to make decisions they never
teach them that their life is theirs to master let's say
and that they have to make a plan
but that the plan has to serve them
we also have a suspicion that maybe men won't work
unless they have their own plan
maybe that's associated with trade agreeableness although
we're still investigating that
but there is no doubt that these
at least as far as our research is shown that these
interventions the future planning interventions
seem to have a more salutary effect on men
but the men are under performing you know so
so for some reason the women don't have the same problem but
it's something like
males won't work unless they have their own reasons to
which wouldn't surprise me given that males are more
disagreeable than females
so it's certainly possible
but you know the effects on dropout
at Mohawk college we're walloping about 50 percent decrease
in the first semester and well of course
that's when kids always drop out
so there's something about having a plan
so we are thinking too that what's happening is
and this kind of goes back to your comments about
both positive and negative emotion
it seems to be something like uncertainty reduction
and so that reduces the effect of doubt let's say
and also
having the person designed a future they also
want tags success with positive emotion
and that carries them forward potentially through obstacles
it'd be very interesting
to analyze the essays that these people wrote
using our computer program
yeah well you know i think
we may have done that if i remember correctly
we may have done that with
the
Rotterdam study but it has to look because we've used your liw
see a couple of times
to look for the same sort of phenomena
we've also done that to look at whether
or not we could extract out
big five traits from
from writing samples and that's also possible so
i'm less less
sanguin about the big five approach
because language and
self reports are really really different animals
yeah well well
i'd like to talk to you now if you would about about your now
you did the computer analysis of words
and that got you interested in different
categories of words correct and
that's right a full book on pronouns that's right
part of the reason
i want to talk to about pronouns apart
from the fact that i'm interested
and is i've been embroiled in a political controversy in Canada
for the last five months
the there has been legislation here
formulated at the federal level
it's already in place in the provincial level
mandating the use of what have been called preferred pronouns
and i Don't know
if that's come to the university of Texas at Austin
or not yet but the idea is that
people of a
non specific gender
let's say have the right to choose the pronouns by which
other people will address them
and that's actually been mandated in Canadian law
which is something i've
been objecting to vociferously
because i Don't believe the government should mandate
language content i think it's a massive error
but anyway so
i have a specific interest in pronouns and i know
also that pronouns are in a closed languister category
so they Don't change that frequently
but you wrote a whole book
describing why
pronouns were so significant from a psychological perspective
right and it's more
it's not just pronouns
it's a whole class of words called function words
and if you look at any text or you listen very carefully
most of what we can be are
what we call content words
these are nouns and regular verbs and and
aged is most adverbs
and they're the guts of what we're talking about
but we have all these little words articles a
and in the prepositions
two of four pronouns he she they it etc
and in English
there's only about 180 common pronouns now
the average person has a vocabulary of a hundred thousand words
but only
you know less than one half of one percent of
those words are these
function words
yet they account for 60 percent of all the words we use
they control how we talk and what they are specifying is
how we connect with one another
and how we connect with our topic
and how we think about ourselves and our group
and by analyzing
these function words
you get a really good sense of who a person is and
that's the underlying theory of
the work i've been doing for the last several years
using this computer program
which is linguistic inquiry word count liw c
which i pronounce Luke
and the Luke program
is really just a dumb program that
mostly is looking at these function words
so so tell us some things that you've found and
with
specific words
so so
let's start off with the most commonly used spoken word
which is the word i
i tells us so much about people
and if you go into your email
you're going to see that use i sometimes
sometimes in an email you won't
so for example
people who were depressed use the word i
more than when they're not depressed
people who are suicidal use it even more
so one of our first studies was looking at
poets who either committed suicide
or didn't and we analyze their poetry
the suicidal poets did not use more negative emotion words
they didn't make more references to death they use the word
i more and why
because pronouns including i
tell us where we're paying attention if use the word
i yourself focus
and you know as a clinician
that one of the theories
of depression is
that it's a disease of self focus that people are so
ruminative and looking inward so much so let me ask you
let me ask you a question about that
that seems related
to the psychometric finding that self consciousness is
a facet of neuroticism
and let me ask you one other question along with that but so
because
self consciousness seems to load with the negative emotions
but also
one of the things that i
often recommend to my clinical clients who are socially anxious
because i've watched how they interact and because they get
self focused
they don't look at other people they don't look at their face
for example
and they're busily thinking about how
other people are looking at them
and they're busily thinking about what they're going to say next
and so what happens is they stop
looking at the face of the people that they're
they're talking to or listening to them
and so then they're extraordinarily awkward and so
what i've done
is instead of telling people to stop thinking about themselves
i've said when you enter a conversation
really really
focus on the other people push your attention outward
and because that seems to activate their unconscious
and automatized professional
let's say socialization that's exactly right skills
and then they can flow with the conversation
that's exactly right and
to build on this the idea of
people who are leaders and status if you look at the two people
you can
you can tell with remarkable accuracy who's the higher status
by the person who uses fewer eyes
the high status person doesn't use the word eye much
the lower status person doesn't because
the high status person
is looking out at the world
and the lower status person as you're pointed out
is looking inward
and you can take this to the bank go
look at your emails and you'll see when you're writing some
of higher status
you tend to use eye more
and when you're writing to someone at lower status
you use eye less
so
okay so let me okay let me tell you another observation that
i've had do you tell me what you think about this
i'm going to tell you with tell you about
an observation from animation first so
i've done some very in depth analysis of various Disney movies
including the lion king
and
the lion king involves
a child and then an adolescent lion
who matures and so
and the animators also represented his father now
his father has a very interesting face
because it looks like this
like it's it's it's focused forward
and kind of staring almost
you have to think of almost predatory
because the predatory gaze is locked on someone else but
and then the adolescent
lion
who's kind of naive and imbecilic in some sense is like this
all the time
and so it seems to me that there's a relationship between
immaturity and
and self focus and maturity and outward focus and
in the lion king
when when the adolescent
lion undergoes this initiation right his face changes into one
like this and do one of determination and
the other thing that seems related to this is that
when people are speaking in front of a group
they often get self conscious
and they feel all the eyes on them
and that makes them self conscious
and one of the things that i've recommended to people who
want to speak to groups is
never to speak to the group
just to look at one individual
and then another individual and then another individual
because that
well that seems to foster communication
but it also blows out the
probability of becoming self conscious
so that's exactly right in fact i have recommended to
teacher trainers so here's what you do
at my university for teacher training you give a
practice lecture and you have the
the camera is in the audience looking at you
that's the wrong way to do it the way that you should
train teachers
is put a camera behind the teacher at the audience
and point out afterwards look
that guy's not paying attention to you that person is and
in other words
not making yourself focus making you that
if you're training a teacher
training a public speaker doing exactly what you're saying
you should give them the view of what the audience looks like
and not what you look like
that's the exact wrong training
absolutely you know
okay so tell me what you think about this when i'm lecturing
i pay attention to the people who are paying attention
now i mean most of the time most people in my lectures
are paying attention at least a reasonable proportion of them
but the ones that aren't
well i don't know why they're not
but there's lots of reasons
they might have had a bad night they might be overtired
they may have taken the course by mistake
i mean god only knows
if
i'm paying attention to the students that are paying attention
then i can read off their faces how the audience is thinking
especially if i glance around
but it's that intense communication
from individual to individual that seems to make a lecture
or an interview or a conversation really compelling
that's exactly right that that
and i think that's the the secret to
one of the secrets to be in a good teacher
and a good speaker is
really being able to watch and and also to judge
when all of a sudden you're starting to lose them
you know
you're and you're also doing little experiments the whole time
you know one of the things that
people who are relatively
new is they start to lose people
and then they start speaking more quickly
which of course is precisely the wrong thing to do
and they start paying less attention
as they get self conscious and want to hide from the audience
and then they get into a loop
and and things just go you know
the worst speakers i've ever seen
stand at the front of the
of the audience with their head down and mumble at their feet
that's just painful i mean
okay okay so that's very interesting so okay
so you talked about i and you talked about dominance
what what else have you learned about specific words
well a couple more things about i mixed with some others
one is his honesty
so the ability to detect deception versus honesty
as function of how people talk
and what we find is that
we've done
many studies where we induce people to lie and tell the truth
and then we look at the transcripts of the two
the one we find is when people tell the truth
they tend to use eye more they're owning what they're saying
and the person who is lying is psychologically distancing
distancing themselves from what they're saying
and then there's another
feature is when you're telling the truth
you tend to
use more words that are we used to call them exclusive words or
differentiation words where you use words like except
but without exclude
words were making a distinction between quests in a category
and not in a category that
these exclusive kind of words are
you're being more honest because you're saying what you did
but also what you didn't do
and that's a really complex cognitive task
whereas if you're lying and you didn't do any of it
to say what you didn't not do
is just be on the capabilities of most people
so both i word usage and these exclusive words together
do a pretty good job and another one is also
focusing on details
so the person can you do there with political speeches
oh yeah and there's been some
there's been some nice research on that as well
uh Jeff Hancock for example
who is not Stanford has
played with this idea quite a bit when he he was looking at
all of the rhetoric about weapons of mass
destruction during the the bush administration that there
that what he found was administrators
were being using deceptive language
prior to to the us before prior to arguing to war
GT GT
so so that opens up the whole
completely
appalling an interesting scenario it's like
i mean increasingly
people are using computer programs to analyze personality
and that sort of thing
by analyzing people's behavior on the web
that's exactly right and we've been doing this a lot with with
political figures in fact
one of my graduate students and i kayla Jordan
we have a website that's called wordwatchers wordwatchers
WordPress Com
and by going there you can see our analysis of Trump
and actually this whole election
from my perspective is a scientist
this has been a phenomenal electoral season
as a human being not so much
so i'm going to get you when we're done here
i'll email you
and you can give me some links okay
that i can put in the description here
where people can go look this sort of thing up
so that's interesting so can you can you actually rank order
politicians
in terms of the probability that they're telling the truth
so we have a
yes i could but i'm not sure i'd trust it very much
because one of the interesting issues about deception is
you've got some people who are decept who are
deceptive but they honestly believe they're telling the truth
and i think Trump actually falls into that category
i think he actually believes what he says
and he might say just the opposite 10 minutes later
and he'll believe that as well
yeah so do you suppose that okay
so that's interesting because
i've seen in poorly written undergraduate essays
you commonly see
i think about it as fracturing at
different levels of the linguistic hierarchy
so you know if you listen to as schizophrenic speak
they're actually fractured at the level of the phrase
and then if you listen to a manic speak
they're more like
fractured out the level of the sentence or the paragraph
they can say a whole paragraph and then in the next paragraph
they'll say something completely different
that contradicts the first paragraph
but there's no awareness of the contradiction
and in poorly written
undergraduate essays there'll be a claim made on page one
and then a claim
made on page two that are completely antithetical
and you know it isn't
self evident that you
become conscious of paradoxes in your thinking unless
you act out both proposition
simultaneously and
it produces a conflict because you can hold
paradox information without ever knowing it
and so maybe
maybe what happens with someone who
who does that sort of contradictory speech is that
temperamentally they're very confident
so they might be assertive for example
that's right agreeable to something like that
and maybe also low in
or high and stress tolerate so they're not anxious people
they're assertive
and they don't really care so much what other people think so
they come across
continually as confident
and so that would be more like temperamental confidence
which is a form
it's a funny thing
because it's not exactly the same as telling the truth
but it is something more like
believing what you say or believing in what you say
that's right and what i think that
the text analytic approach is better at it's when a person
knows them well
they're telling to lie
and that's when
our tells do better there's another phenomenon
it's called a performative
that's one of my favorites that you can did you hear and that is
performatives are used in linguistics
and they're usually a phrase and they might be something like
let me assure you or as i've said before
or believe me when i say
and if you have a performative it makes the entire sentence
you're not able to detect if it's true or not
so you can't establish the truth value
let me assure you that this is a glass of
water
now is that true or not well it's yes actually it is because
i want to assure you as a glass of water
it's true because i want to assure you that it is even though
it's not
what happens is
consciously we don't know we do this
but it's almost so our brain is kind of trying to protect us
and we throw these up and
there's i i have another webpage that has
a number of performatives that you see in president
after president
where the president says something
that the beginning
sets it up so it's performed it and then the second half
sure enough
it is a line
yeah well so do you suppose that
okay that's interesting so do you suppose that
so is the performative a marker for disease is it is
i think it is something deceptive
is coming
yes i think it is and in fact in fact
trump's great his bestwood is believe me so right
i know more about the army than the generals believe me
right right
he is
quite interesting to convince himself
he is and
it's a form of performative which is he's really saying
please believe me that i know more
he doesn't place it that way
but that's what it essentially is right well
it kind of makes you wonder if he thinks that if
people believe him
that makes it true
yeah exactly no
because it's a funny thing because there is some
truth to the idea that
true things are what other people believe
now obviously you Don't want to go too far down that road
but there is something i mean because for example
a contract holds no truth unless there's consensus around it
嗯哼
so whenever the reality is dependent on everyone agreeing
to do the same thing
then consensus is actually a very good marker for truth
because there's lots of situations where you say well
if we agree on all this
then it's going to be true that's what a contract is
so it's almost as if
using words like that is an attempt to establish a contract
where no contract can genuinely be established i mean
we can't have a contract about whether
or Iran has weapons of mass destruction
but we can certainly have a contract about whether
or not we'll go to war over it
嗯哼
yeah yeah
so what i should start with regards to two interesting words
because that was
fast and there's a there's a whole
we could go for hours on this actually so
another one that i've been quite interested in is using these
groups of words and looking at how two people connect
in terms of these
function words so what we could do is
we could actually calculate the percentage agreement
we have in our use of pronouns prepositions
articles conjunctions and so forth
and we call this language style matching and the closer
two people are
in their use of these words in a given conversation
the more they are in tune in one another
and so that's being on the same wavelength
that's exactly right and it's not necessarily liking one another
it's been
absolutely paying attention to one another
so two people in the midst of an argument
tend to entrain
really closely just like two people madly in love
now we've done analyses of transcripts of speed days
and what we find is
we actually can predict who will go on a subsequent date
at rates somewhat hired in the people of themselves
so what's happening is the rapid
establishment of neutral imitation
that's exactly right
exactly what happens
from the piazhirian perspective when two children start to play
that that's exactly right and and
and we've looked at
one that i particularly like was we studied we looked at
86 dating couples these were freshman
in college and freshman in college are in
notoriously unstable relationships
which from my perspective is perfect for research
and to be in our studies they had to
do instant messaging at least daily with each other
and to give us 10 days of their ims
which they did
and what we did
and we also asked them how good is your relationship
how likely will you be together in several months
and what we found was
that we did a shockingly good job
at predicting who'd still be together
those people who were we just average
got their style matching score their average
trainment score and we just got the top half
80 percent were still together three months later
if they were in the bottom half
only 50 percent were still together
and self reports
people self reports about their relationship
was
absolutely unrelated to whether or not they were still together
so so
that's like dancing
it is i've always thought of this as a chance
that's exactly right
yeah yeah
because so so what that really means in some sense is that
think about it this way is that
the two people come together
and the two of them it's as if they're making something
they make something jointly that they're both acting out
so that they're uniting into something central
that's right
and then you might think too that in order for that to happen
they have to be paying close attention to each other
yes right
right and so you can't entrain with someone
unless you pay close attention to them
and certainly one of the
best markers for the
utility of a relationship is going to be whether or not
the people pay attention
to each other right
that's exactly right
that's why
children are so absolutely desperate for adult attention
that's their currency
yes that's exactly right
wow that's really cool well if you go to another one
okay i got another one
a few
three or four years ago
i started working with much bigger data set so
this was with about 25
000 college students who
have been admitted to my university over four years
and i got their admissions essays and these essays are people
explaining why they want to come to the university
you know how they have overcome
a difficult time or something like that
so each person wrote two essays
and
we went through and start to do some kind of
general analysis of word use focusing on these function words
and found that there was a central dimension to language
this is a fundamental dimension and it's
what i'm calling it is analytic versus narrative thinking
people high on analytic thinking are using high
rates of articles and prepositions
at the other end of this dimension
are people who are using high rates of pronouns
auxiliary verbs conjunctions
negations and so forth
it is a coherent dimension and that any text
can be put along this continuum and in fact
it's like a fingerprint
people who you know
use words at this
level tend to do so in other in other if it's emails
other emails or natural conversation etc
so are the narrative people using more metaphors
yeah they probably would
tell me
how you would tell the difference if you were well
let's say before we get into metaphors
metaphors are going to take us down a rabbit hole
so let's before we fall down the hole let me just point out
this analytic thinking was so cool about it
is we were able to track these students grades over the next
four years of college
and the higher they were on analytic thinking
the better they did in college
and in terms of grades it was correlated about 1.2
and it did matter if they were physics majors or fine art majors
if they were in engineering
psychology
music
social work that this
you could
take this to the bank the more analytica person is in their sa
the better
they do in college and part of it is is college is based
on analytic thinking right
but it's also correlated with intelligence it's correlated with
sat which
probably about point 3.35 oh yeah
that's pretty good
that's pretty hard
it is really quite striking and what's interesting
is is that we can now use this
as kind of a remote sensor
to get a sense of how smart somebody is so for analyzing man
you're a dangerous man
i'm a dangerous man
for sure
yeah yeah so that's another one
and we've been playing with
many other things we've been doing a lot of work on author
identification
so we published a cool article
one of my graduate students Ryan Boyd
and i've been focusing on
a lost play or a play that was attributed to Shakespeare
but people didn't know if it was or not
and we were able to do some really smart analysis showing
pretty clearly that it was written by Shakespeare probably Co
authored with another guy John Fletcher
and we've looked at some other
manuscripts that have been called into
question that have come out of the 17th century
so we know we've been taking this work in all of these different
directions
cool okay
so let's close this off by why
Don't you tell us something about
what you're doing
with regards to revamping
undergraduate education at the university of Texas and what you
and what your aims are
and also why it was that you were
exactly
it all gets into my analysis of language
i was doing all of this work
trying to understand
could i get a say a group of initially two people
but then there's many of five people
to interact with one another on the computer
and if so could i track how they are interacting with each other
and get a sense of how the group was working
and i working with some
computer sciences
we were able to come up with a really slick program to do that
it didn't occur to me
wouldn't it be interesting to do that in a large class
because i taught
a large introductory psychology class with colleague mine
Sam gosling
and we had five hundred students in the class
we had them bring a laptop to school class one day
and we were able to break the class into small groups of five
each they could
interact with each other
and we were able to track how
they were interacting and we could get feedback to the group
trying to get the group to work better
so we using the style matching
we could tell people whether or not people
members the group were paying attention
attention to each other or someone was talking too much we could
ask them to not talk so much and so forth
and it worked
the next semester
we realized you know we could use this idea
and revamp the class from top to bottom
where we got rid of the textbook
so all readers were online
we'd have a quiz at the beginning of every class
we would have break the class into interactions more frequently
in other words started to rethink the class from top to bottom
and then we moved it into an online class
so that we were able to
broadcast out and we
switched the format of the class it was like a tv show
so we were behind the desk we'd have fake news we'd have
or at least one of us would be in front of a green screen
or some other place
fake news i'm not sure that that's a program
no no it used to be people used to know what i meant
but i now as as soon as i said that i realize
i can't use that anymore
but this idea of one of us would be on
on a in front of a scene somewhere on earth you know
so so
one of us you know i would say Sam where are you
it looks like you are in a balloon today
and you know so it looks like he's in a balloon it's over
in any case the point was we turn this into a television show
and what we found was that
by broadcasting this out to 1500 students
we set it up because there was testing every day that students
were in class every day they were
focusing more on the material
they were more engaged
and it turns out that their average performance went up
compared to when we taught it in the past
and more impressively
we
people who took
our online class
did better in the other classes they were taking that semester
oh yeah
and the classes they took the semester afterwards
what kind of improvement did you give
it wasn't huge it was like a difference between a three point
one versus a three point two five
and we reduce the disparity
between
upper middle and lower middle class students in terms of their
performance so that
historically we found a
one letter grade
between the upper middle and lower middle class students yep
and now we had reduced it to point four letter grade okay
that's big
that's big so that's
an elegant to what was happening with the with
the future authoring program
that's right and that's and
so how do you account for that why
do you think
it had that differential effect on the lower performing students
well it turns out
we came across some previous research that had
found similar effects
but it deals with frequent testing
the idea is kids who come from lower middle class backgrounds
five and large went to crappy high schools
and in these high schools by the way
our kids are all smart they're always most of them in the top 7
percent of their high school class
but if they were at a crappy high school
they learn to get by by memorizing
because the tests were memorization
tests and so these kids were great at memorizing
and then they come to a real university
where you're not tested on memorization
you have to think conceptually right
right
and historically when we taught those client
the classes we had this
usual three or four tests over the course of semester
i would always get students in my office
walking in after the first test saying
i have never made a b in my life
and i just failed your first test that's impossible
how is this even possible and i would say
how did you study well
i had flash guards i did this i memorized this and i said
i told you memorization doesn't work
you have to think conceptually
and that doesn't mean anything to these kids
but now you've got a test every day
and you fail that first test power you fail the second test
power and all of a sudden you're realizing
wow it's true memorizing doesn't work
so okay so you think what's happening
is that they're learning that memorization doesn't work faster
that's exactly right that's really funny
that's really funny
and they use these skills in their
other classes because they realize
memorization's not working in the other classes either
so how do they catch on to the
okay so now they know that memorization doesn't work
how do they figure out what does work
well well
it's been interesting moving to the online world
we create all of these videos
which basically there's a video on how to take how to study
there's another video on how to take a test in another video on
you know how do you manage your time in other words
now
we understand the problem a lot better than we did before
and so students are taking advantage of these
resources and end up doing better
that's cool so how long have you been doing that
so
after
so we started the class the first year in 2011
and then
in the years afterwards i started talking to people
at the university of Texas
and elsewhere about kind of the big picture of education
which was
what the hell are we doing in education right now you know
the world has changed that
i'd be asked myself
i know but the world's changed
why do we have three hour courses there's no logic for
a three hour course
why do we have a semester
that goes from the first of January to sometime in
may there's no reason for that
why do we have a half hour course
why do we have a seven hour course
in other words
why do we put things together the way
we do it turns out there's really good reasons because in the
early 1900s
we need a standardized way of talking about credit and so forth
and then we built computers to program this in
and we built buildings that
we knew how to use time and space and location
and so that
your computer will
tell you this calassa is going to meet in this room
at this time
and your final exam will be at this place in this place
we Don't need all the things yeah well
that's all it's analogous to the conservation of
a physical structure and evolution
that's exactly right and we Don't and what's interesting is
the university of Texas computer
the registrar uses can't make a half hour course right
it can't change the semester
it can't do
any of these things at a modern student information system
computer cost an unbelievable amount of money and so
what i'm doing is
i am working with the university and the entire infrastructure
to start to rethink everything
what should be the curriculum
we don't need all these required courses that we used to have
it makes no sense
you know
a lot of our requirements made a lot of since 50 years ago
and a lot of our classes were flunk out
classes we don't need flunk out classes anymore
and we can come up with really
brief classes half hour classes to learn
a basic skill for example
we have a requirement
you have to have a statistics course to take upper division
psychology classes
do you really need the statistics course
well most of it you don't and if i ask my
the people teaching statistics
asking them
do the statistics you're teaching are they relevant to today
and they all say oh
not at all i mean i don't use analysis variants
i don't use t tests
i use linear regression i use this
i use that but we can't teach that
and my view is if you're going to take my upper division class
you better know correlations
and you better know correlations up and down
i can teach a correlation course
that would be a point seven hour course
and
download it and take it any time i don't care when you take it
well one of the i mean i've been
using YouTube a lot
for the last three years you know and that's right
i started putting my lectures online just just
taped with an iPad you know
and by by the beginning of 2016
i'd collected about a million views
and i thought
oh that's that's a whole different thing that i
thought it was i thought YouTube was for cute cat videos and
then i started thinking it through
and i thought oh no look here's the situation man
for the first time in human history
the spoken word has as much staying power
and reach as books no more
reach you can publish faster
and it can be broken up and communicated in all sorts of chunks
it's like this is absolutely revolutionary
that seems to me that while your
universities are in a race against time that's exactly right
because this is the new world order
and it's you know it's like every other part of our
world right now where we're dealing with the future of
ai and the future of everything that
this really messes with the world order because
so much of what we can teach
can be put up there and it you know because
correlations haven't changed a hell of a lot in the last
hundred years
you Don't need to update your lecture on correlations right
there's something
one really good lecture on correlation
thousand of them or ten thousand of them
that's also very frightening
that's exactly right and but then
we do need you know
you know we're talking now fifteenth century
we do need a guild mentality if you're going to become
a therapist a scientist
or this or that you need to have some serious
lab experience you need to have some serious experience
doing things in addition to
learning how to think
and to get some smart feedback on how to think
how to how to come up to
get up to the level to understand
what's involved in trying to make new size to make new advances
it's a it's a incredibly exciting time
and i'm working with all parts of the university i have
two hundred people working with me i've got various
you know we're dealing with a development studio
working on new ways of thinking of online
and other technologies i've got
a big research and methods group
trying to find out
what even works we Don't even know what works and what does it
we're having to deal with
extended campus in terms of how we can
push out
our classes our information to the world
in a way that has some kind of financial
value to the university
we
in this office that you guys said
you guys been thinking about accreditation because
it seems to me that
this is
the big ish
well the thing is is that the
ability to disseminate valuable information was once
that university in some sense had a hammer lock on that
that's gone no more hammer lock
that's right what the thing that
the impediment to mass education at the moment in some sense
is the problem of mass accreditation
and university still have a hammerlock on that
but there's no reason that they need to
so i'm curious when you're thinking about the mass
distribution of educational material
what have you been thinking about
in relationship
the problems and the complexity of this are unbelievable so
some of it is
the nationwide bureaucracy so there are accrediting
agencies that
that Don't know how to use deal with fractional credit
Don't know how to deal with the variable calendar
we've got
financial aid issues because they're based on these old systems
as well we're dealing with with intellectual
property in terms of
who owns the ip of a class is
that the instructors at the university
can the university resell it
how do we rethink this
you know the idea of having free
open classes is great
but it's not a very good business model
and this has been one of the problems with corsaira and Ed act
and you're putting your videos online for free because
the reality is it costly
i've been using patreon
you know you know about patreon
no i Don't it's really interesting
it's a platform that
was developed because of the difficulties that creative
people were having and monetizing their production
and so with patreon
people can voluntarily buy a monthly subscription
if they find that the content that you're producing
is worth supporting
then they can donate monthly to your patreon account
and they can either do that
on a monthly basis or they can pay you a donation per
video that you put up huh
and that's been a very you know i thought with my YouTube
content because i wanted to professionalize
what i was doing to some degree to hire a film
crew and to increase improve the audio and all of that and
i threw up a
a patreon account online
last April when i found out about the technology
just a curiosity and i got about
i don't know 60 or 70 people subscribing in the first month
so that was kind of interesting and
and it's enabled me to hire a film
crew and that sort of thing but it's quite interesting because
the patreon people
although there's some perks they get like
i send the higher donors assigned
copy of of one of my books for example
but mostly they don't get access to
any content that everyone doesn't get access to
but people people have a strong sense of reciprocity
and they're not completely comfortable with the
idea of getting something for nothing
and
that the patreon account is being extraordinarily useful to me
it's it's very interesting yeah
well
in these and these we're doing now for example
and these
are issues that we're struggling with at the university
in terms of how do we do it
because to do one of our courses is really quite expensive and
ten twenty thirty thousand dollars
trying to figure out the model for it
the one thing that we can do is we can give university credit
so
that's one that's one hold that we have
but it you know it
really does deal with a broader issue in our society which is
is knowing the material and knowing
and knowing how to think sufficient to get by in the real world
or do you need the official credential and
yeah well you hopefully you need both
yes or you know
if it was a just world
just knowing the material would be would be sufficient
yeah well the problem is it gives you no rapid way of
telling the charlottens from a real thing
that's that's the big issue and that's the big issue
and then another
problem is is that as the credential becomes more important
the knowledge becomes less important
because you can use the credential to what
to play the system
that's right that's exactly right
so these are the kinds of things that i've been dealing with
and i'm
trying to change a giant bureaucracy turns out
not real easy yeah
you said why it has all these built in assumptions that
are part of the structure
not only not only part of the cognitive apparatus
but actually
built right into the infrastructure that's exactly right
and what i found is
the people of the university had been very supportive
i thought for sure
i would run into major obstacles
faculty students administrators
even the legislators because this is a public university
are all really supportive
and even though i've got support all around
it's still just like swimming through molasses
because there are all of these
rules and regulations that have been there
sometimes for a hundred years
that's no longer server purpose well
you know that's you know
maybe you know
maybe you Don't know
but the typical fortune 500 company only lost 30 years
and the typical family fortune three generations
and it's for the reasons that you just describe is what happens
is that
the structure itself becomes
so inachronistic that not even the people
within it can change it
yep and so
something comes along that's that's younger
and that's built on
different pre suppositions it just takes it out
and
the probability that that's going to happen to the universities
in my opinion
is overwhelmingly high
because of exactly the sorts of things that you described
it's structural
it's built for a different century
yes
and built for the late 1800s
well it is and actually
if you think about it university started in the 1400s
and it's amazing that they have survived as well
as they have yeah
that's for sure that's for sure
well look it was really good talking to you
i've enjoyed this myself
i've been a great admirer of your research
and i don't say that likely
because well thank you
there's a handful of
psychologist that have had a profound effect
on me and you're certainly one of them and
i would also say
you're a spectacular rarity among
social psychologists in my estimation
so
i know that's a nasty thing to say but
being partly a social psychologist i guess i'm allowed to say it
so i would
also like to talk to you
again at some point in the future maybe you know
six months down the road or something
because
you have all sorts of things that people need to know about and
this is a really good way of telling people about them
so
i'll email you and get some if you can think of three or four
links and a little description
that you'd like to go along with them
i'll put them in the description of the video and
i'll tell you when both the podcast and the video will be up
but that'll be very soon
okay sounds good send me an email and i will
we'll do that all right
very nice talking with you
nice talking with you as well thanks so much all right all right
bye bye bye bye
